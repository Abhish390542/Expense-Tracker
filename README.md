# Expense-Tracker
This Java program allows the user to keep track of expenses weekly or monthly. It documents spending by categories, it calculates totals and compared with previous data to point out changes. It also predicts on the future expenditures based on the current trends and help the users to plan ahead and save effectively.


Expense Tracker is a simple Java program that intended to assist users in managing their finances, which involves recording and analyzing expenses. The user is first asked to select whether he or she wants to track expenses weekly or monthly. Upon selection, the program will ask the user to input his spending on specific categories that are preprogrammed like Food, Travel, Entertainment, Bills, and Others. These inputs are accumulated and then added up to get the total expenses of the period selected.

When the user chooses weekly tracking, the program will automatically project an estimate of a monthly projection of the expense by multiplying the weekly expenses with four. This enables the user to make comparisons between long term and short term expenditure. Expenses of the past month can also be inputted in the program and then the difference between the two periods calculated to provide an understanding of whether expenditure has risen, fallen, or leveled off.

The code also favours simple future cost estimations. It will estimate the amount that the user may spend within the next few weeks or months by examining trends in expenses that they currently incur. This forecasting feature allows users to arrange their finances.

Generally, the program is straightforward, effective and very practical, as it provides both expense tracking and forecasting within a single location.
